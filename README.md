# Landing Page Project

This project is the seccond part of a web degree by the company "Udacity", specifically its "nanodegree program in WebDevelopment".

The task at hand was to programmatially add a navigation bar to a given website (cloned project). The use case is a Website, that e.g. asynchronously gets its content while still in need to build an accurate navigation. In order to guarantee performance, measures such as creating document fragments are used. Styles have been deemed not so important.
